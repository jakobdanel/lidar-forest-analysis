To ensure the validity of our findings, we derive three patches for each species, thereby confirming that observed variables are characteristic of a particular species rather than a specific patch. Each patch is carefully selected to encompass an area of approximately 50-100 hectares and contain between 5,000 and 10,000 trees.

It then calls the lfa_download_areas function to download the specified areas and lfa_create_tile_location_objects to create tile location objects based on Lidar data files in those areas. The shapefile MUST follow the following requirements:\n\nEach geometry must be a single object of type polygon\nEach entry must have the following attributes:\nspecies: A string describing the tree species of the area.\nname: A string describing the location of the area.\n\n\n\nValue\nA vector containing tile location objects.\n\n\nExamples\n\n# Initialize LFA processing with the default shapefile\nlfa_init()\n\n# Initialize LFA processing with a custom shapefile\nlfa_init(\"custom_areas.shp\")\n\n# Example usage with the default shapefile\nlfa_init()\n\n# Example usage with a custom shapefile\nlfa_init(\"custom_areas.shp\")\n\n\n\nUsage\n\nlfa_init(sf_file = \"research_areas.shp\")\n\n\n\n\nlfa_intersect_areas\nIntersect Lidar Catalog with Spatial Features\n\nArguments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nctg\nA LAScatalog object representing the Lidar data to be processed.\n\n\ntile_location\nA tile location object representing the specific area of interest.\n\n\nareas_sf\nSpatial features defining areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nThis function intersects a Lidar catalog with a specific area defined by spatial features.\n\n\nDetails\nThe function intersects the Lidar catalog specified by ctg with a specific area defined by the tile_location object and areas_sf . It removes points outside the specified area and returns a modified LAScatalog object.\nThe specified area is identified based on the species and name attributes in the tile_location object. If a matching area is not found in areas_sf , the function stops with an error.\nThe function then transforms the spatial reference of the identified area to match that of the Lidar catalog using sf::st_transform .\nThe processing is applied to each chunk in the catalog using the identify_area function, which merges spatial information and filters out points that are not classified as inside the identified area. After processing, the function writes the modified LAS files back to the original file locations, removing points outside the specified area.\nIf an error occurs during the processing of a chunk, a warning is issued, and the function continues processing the next chunks. If no points are found after filtering, a warning is issued, and NULL is returned.\n\n\nSeealso\nOther functions in the Lidar forest analysis (LFA) package.\n\n\nValue\nA modified LAScatalog object with points outside the specified area removed.\n\n\nExamples\n\n# Example usage\nlfa_intersect_areas(ctg, tile_location, areas_sf)\n\n# Example usage\nlfa_intersect_areas(ctg, tile_location, areas_sf)\n\n\n\nUsage\n\nlfa_intersect_areas(ctg, tile_location, areas_sf)\n\n\n\n\nlfa_load_ctg_if_not_present\nLoading the catalog if it is not present\n\nArguments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nctg\nCatalog object.

The mapping function should accept a tile location object as its first argument, and additional arguments can be passed using the ellipsis ( ... ) syntax.\nThis function is useful for performing operations on multiple tile locations concurrently, such as loading Lidar data, processing areas, or other tasks that involve tile locations.\n\n\nSeealso\nThe mapping function provided should be compatible with the structure and requirements of the tile locations and the specific task being performed.\n\n\nValue\nNone\n\n\nExamples\n\n# Example usage\nlfa_map_tile_locations(tile_locations, my_mapping_function, param1 = \"value\")\n\n# Example usage\nlfa_map_tile_locations(tile_locations, my_mapping_function, param1 = \"value\")\n\n\n\nUsage\n\nlfa_map_tile_locations(tile_locations, map_function, check_flag = NULL, ...)\n\n\n\n\nlfa_merge_and_save\nMerge and Save Text Files in a Directory\n\nArguments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ninput_directory\nThe path to the input directory containing text files.\n\n\noutput_name\nThe name for the output file where the merged content will be saved.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nThis function takes an input directory and an output name as arguments. It merges the textual content of all files in the specified directory into a single string, with each file’s content separated by a newline character. The merged content is then saved into a file named after the output name in the same directory. After the merging is complete, all input files are deleted.\n\n\nDetails\nThis function reads the content of each text file in the specified input directory and concatenates them into a single string. Each file’s content is separated by a newline character. The merged content is then saved into a file named after the output name in the same directory. Finally, all input files are deleted from the directory.\n\n\nSeealso\nreadLines , writeLines , file.remove\n\n\nValue\nThis function does not explicitly return any value. It prints a message indicating the successful completion of the merging and saving process.\n\n\nExamples\n\n# Merge text files in the \"data_files\" directory and save the result in \"merged_output\"\nlfa_merge_and_save(\"data_files\", \"merged_output\")\n\n# Merge text files in the \"data_files\" directory and save the result in \"merged_output\"\nlfa_merge_and_save(\"data_files\", \"merged_output\")\n\n\n\nUsage\n\nlfa_merge_and_save(input_directory, output_name)\n\n\n\n\nlfa_rd_to_qmd\nConvert Rd File to Markdown\n\nArguments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nrdfile\nThe path to the Rd file or a parsed Rd object.\n\n\noutfile\nThe path to the output Markdown file (including the file extension).\n\n\nappend\nLogical, indicating whether to append to an existing file (default is FALSE).\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This function is nearly identical to the Rd2md::Rd2markdown function from the Rd2md package. We needed to implement our own version of it because of various reasons:\n\nThe algorithm uses hardcoded header sizes (h1 and h2 in original) which is not feasible for our use-case of the markdown.\nWe needed to add some Quarto Markdown specifics, e.g. to make sure that the examples will not be runned.\nWe want to exclude certain tags from our implementation.\n\n\n\nDetails\nFor that reason we copied the method and made changes as needed and also added this custom documentation.\nThis function converts an Rd (R documentation) file to Markdown format (.md) and saves the converted file at the specified location. The function allows appending to an existing file or creating a new one. The resulting Markdown file includes sections for the function’s name, title, and additional content such as examples, usage, arguments, and other sections present in the Rd file.\nThe function performs the following steps:\n\nParses the Rd file using the Rd2md package.\nCreates a Markdown file with sections for the function’s name, title, and additional content.\nAppends the content to an existing file if append is set to TRUE.\nSaves the resulting Markdown file at the specified location.\n\n\n\nSeealso\nRd2md::parseRd\n\n\nValue\nThis function does not explicitly return any value. It saves the converted Markdown file at the specified location as described in the details section.\n\n\nExamples\n\n# Convert Rd file to Markdown and save it\nlfa_rd_to_md(\"path/to/your/file.Rd\", \"path/to/your/output/file.md\")\n\n# Convert Rd file to Markdown and append to an existing file\nlfa_rd_to_md(\"path/to/your/file.Rd\", \"path/to/existing/output/file.md\", append = TRUE)\n\n\n\nUsage\n\nlfa_rd_to_qmd(rdfile, outfile, append = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nlfa_rd_to_results\nConvert Rd Files to Markdown and Merge Results\n\nDescription\nThis function converts all Rd (R documentation) files in the “man” directory to Markdown format (.qmd) and saves the converted files in the “results/appendix/package-docs” directory. It then merges the converted Markdown files into a single string and saves the merged content into a file named “docs.qmd” in the “results/appendix/package-docs” directory.\n\n\nDetails\nThe function performs the following steps:\n\nRemoves any existing “docs.qmd” file in the “results/appendix/package-docs” directory.\nFinds all Rd files in the “man” directory.\nConverts each Rd file to Markdown format (.qmd) using the lfa_rd_to_qmd function.\nSaves the converted Markdown files in the “results/appendix/package-docs” directory.\nMerges the content of all converted Markdown files into a single string.\nSaves the merged content into a file named “docs.qmd” in the “results/appendix/package-docs” directory.\n\n\n\nSeealso\nlfa_rd_to_qmd , lfa_merge_and_save\n\n\nValue\nThis function does not explicitly return any value. It performs the conversion, merging, and saving operations as described in the details section.\n\n\nExamples\n\n# Convert Rd files to Markdown and merge the results\nlfa_rd_to_results()\n\n\n\nUsage\n\nlfa_rd_to_results()\n\n\n\n\nlfa_segmentation\nSegment the elements of an point cloud by trees\n\nArguments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nctg\nAn LASCatalog object. If not null, it will perform the actions on this object, if NULL inferring the catalog from the tile_location\n\n\ntile_location\nA tile_location type object holding the information about the location of the catalog. This is used to save the catalog after processing too.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\nJakob Danel\n\n\nDescription\nThis function will try to to divide the hole point cloud into unique trees. Therefore it is assigning for each chunk of the catalog a treeID for each point. Therefore the algorithm uses the li2012 implementation with the following parameters: li2012(dt1 = 2, dt2 = 3, R = 2, Zu = 10, hmin = 5, speed_up = 12) NOTE : The operation is in place and can not be reverted, the old values of the point cloud will be deleted!\n\n\nValue\nA catalog where each chunk has additional treeID values indicating the belonging tree.\n\n\nUsage\n\nlfa_segmentation(ctg, tile_location)\n\n\n\n\nlfa_set_flag\nSet a flag to indicate the completion of a specific process.\n\nArguments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nflag_name\nA character string specifying the name of the flag file. It should be a descriptive and unique identifier for the process being flagged.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nThis function creates a hidden flag file at a specified location within the working directory to indicate that a particular processing step has been completed. If the flag file already exists, a warning is issued.\n\n\nValue\nThis function does not have a formal return value.\n\n\nExamples\n\n# Set the flag for a process named \"data_processing\"\nlfa_set_flag(\"data_processing\")\n\n\n\nUsage\n\nlfa_set_flag(flag_name)"

    "text": "2.1 Data acquisition\nOur primary objective is to identify patches where one tree species exhibits a high level of dominance, striving to capture monocultural stands within the diverse forests of Nordrhein-Westfalia (NRW). Recognizing the practical challenges of finding true monocultures, we aim to identify patches where one species is highly dominant, enabling meaningful comparisons across different species.\nThe study is framed within the NRW region due to the availability of an easily accessible dataset. Our focus includes four prominent tree species in NRW: oak, beech, spruce, and pine, representing the most prevalent species in the region. To ensure the validity of our findings, we derive three patches for each species, thereby confirming that observed variables are characteristic of a particular species rather than a specific patch. Each patch is carefully selected to encompass an area of approximately 50-100 hectares and contain between 5,000 and 10,000 trees. Striking a balance between relevance and manageability, these patches avoid excessive size to enhance the likelihood of capturing varied species mixes and ensure compatibility with local hardware.\nSpecific Goals:\n\nRetrieve patches with highly dominant tree species.\nMinimize or eliminate the presence of human-made structures within the selected patches.\n\nTo achieve our goals, we utilized the waldmonitor dataset (Welle et al. 2022) and the map provided by (Blickensdoerfer 2022), both indicating dominant tree species in NRW. We identified patches of feasible size where both sources predicted the presence of a specific species. Further validation involved examining sentinel images of these forest regions to assess the evenness of structures, leaf color distribution, and the absence of significant human-made structures such as roads or buildings. The subsequent preprocessing steps, detailed in the following subsection, involved refining our selected patches and deriving relevant variables, such as tree distribution and density, to ensure that the chosen areas align with the desired research domains."

    "text": "2.2 Preprocessing\nIn this research study, the management and processing of a large dataset are crucial considerations. The dataset’s substantial size necessitates careful maintenance to ensure efficient handling. Furthermore, the data should be easily processable and editable to facilitate necessary corrections and precalculations within the context of our research objectives. To achieve our goals, we have implemented a framework that automatically derives data based on a shapefile, delineating areas of interest. The processed data and results of precalculations are stored in a straightforward manner to enhance accessibility. Additionally, we have designed functions that establish a user-friendly interface, enabling the execution of algorithms on subsets of the data, such as distinct species. These interfaces are not only directly callable by users but can also be integrated into other functions to automate processes. The overarching aim is to streamline the entire preprocessing workflow using a single script, leveraging only the shapefile as a basis. This subsection details the accomplishments of our R-package in realizing these goals, outlining the preprocessing steps undertaken and justifying their necessity in the context of our research.\nThe data are stored in a data subdirectory of the root directory in the format species/location-name/tile-name. To automate the matching of areas of interest with the catalog from the Land NRW1, we utilize the intersecting tool developed by Heisig2. This tool, allows for the automatic retrieval and placement of data downloaded from the Land NRW catalog. To enhance data accessibility, we have devised an object that incorporates species, location name, and tile name (the NRW internal identifier) for each area This object facilitates the specification of the area to be processed. Additionally, we have defined an initialization function that downloads all tiles, returning a list of tile location objects for subsequent processing. A pivotal component of the package’s preprocessing functionality is the map function, which iterates over a list of tile locations (effectively the entire dataset) and accepts a processing function as an argument. The subsequent paragraph outlines the specific preprocessing steps employed, all of which are implemented within the mapping function.\nTo facilitate memory-handling capabilities, each of the tiles, where one area can span multiple tiles, has been split into manageable chunks. We employed a 50x50m size for each tile, resulting in the division of original 1km x 1km files into 400 tiles. These tiles are stored in our directory structure, with each tile housed in a directory named after its tile name and assigned an id as the filename. Implementation-wise, the lidr::catalog_retile function was instrumental in achieving this segmentation. The resulting smaller chunks allow for efficient iteration during subsequent preprocessing steps.\nThe next phase involves reducing our data to the actual size by intersecting the tiles with the defined area of interest. Using the lidR::merge_spatial function, we intersect the area derived from the shapefile, removing all point cloud items outside this region. Due to our tile-wise approach, empty tiles may arise, and in such cases, those tiles are simply deleted.\nFollowing the size reduction to our dataset, the next step involves correcting the z values. The z values in the data are originally relative to the ellipsoid used for referencing, but we require them to be relative to the ground. To achieve this, we utilize the lidR::tin function, which extrapolates a convex hull between all ground points (classified by the data provider) and calculates the z value based on this structure.\nSubsequently, we aim to perform segmentation for each distinct tree, marking each item of the point cloud with a tree ID. We employ the algorithm described by Li et al. (2012), using parameters li2012(dt1 = 2, dt2 = 3, R = 2, Zu = 10, hmin = 5, speed_up = 12). The meanings of these parameters are elucidated in Li et al.’s work (Li et al. 2012).\nFinally, the last preprocessing step involves individual tree detection, seeking a single POINT object for each tree. The lidR::lmf function, an implementation of the tree data using a local maximum approach, is utilized for this purpose (Popescu and Wynne 2004). The results are stored in GeoPackage files within our data structure.\nSee Section 5.1 for the implementation of the preprocessing."

The patches centroids are displayed on a basemap describing the borders from NRW.\n\n\n\n\nWe draw three patches for each species from different regions (see Table 1). We download the LiDAR data for those patches and runned all preprocessing steps as described. We than checked with certain derived parameters (e.g. tree heights, tree distributions or tree density) that all patches contain valid forest data. In that step we discovered, that in one patch some forest clearance took place in the near past. This patch was removed from the dataset and was replaced with a new one.\nIn our research, drawing patches evenly distributed across Nordrhein-Westfalia is inherently constrained by natural factors. Consequently, the patches for oak and pine predominantly originate from the Münsterland region, as illustrated in Figure 1. For spruce, the patches were derived from Sauerland, reflecting the prevalence of spruce forests in this specific region within NRW, as corroborated by Welle et al. (Welle et al. 2022) and Blickensdörfer et al. (Blickensdoerfer 2022). Beech patches, on the other hand, were generated from diverse locations within NRW. Across all patches, no human-made objects were identified, with the exception of small paths for pedestrians and forestry vehicles.\nThe distribution of area and detections is notable for each four species. Beech covers 69,791.9 hectares with a total of 5,954 detections, oak spans 63,232.49 hectares with 5,354 detections, pine extends across 72,862.4 hectares with 8,912 detections, and spruce encompasses 57,940.02 hectares with 8,619 detections. Both the amount of detections and the corresponding area exhibit a relatively uniform distribution across the diverse patches, as summarized in Table 1.\nWith the selected dataset described, we intentionally chose three patches for each four species that exhibit a practical and usable size for our research objectives. These carefully chosen patches align with the conditions essential for our study, providing comprehensive and representative data for in-depth analysis and meaningful insights into the characteristics of each tree species within the specified areas.\n\n\nCode\nshp &lt;- sf::read_sf(\"research_areas.shp\")\ntable &lt;- lfa::lfa_get_all_areas()\n\nsf::sf_use_s2(FALSE)\nfor (row in 1:nrow(table)) {\n  area &lt;-\n    dplyr::filter(shp, shp$species == table[row, \"specie\"] &\n                    shp$name == table[row, \"area\"])\n  area_size &lt;- area |&gt; sf::st_area()\n  point &lt;- area |&gt; sf::st_centroid() |&gt; sf::st_coordinates()\n  table[row,\"point\"] &lt;- paste0(\"(\",round(point[1], digits = 4),\", \",round(point[2],digits = 4),\")\")\n  \n  table[row, \"area_size\"] = round(area_size,digits = 2) #paste0(round(area_size,digits = 2), \" m²\")\n  \n  amount_det &lt;- nrow(lfa::lfa_get_detection_area(table[row, \"specie\"], table[row, \"area\"]))\n  if(is.null(amount_det)){\n    cat(nrow(lfa::lfa_get_detection_area(table[row, \"specie\"], table[row, \"area\"])),table[row, \"specie\"],table[row, \"area\"])\n  }\n  table[row, \"amount_detections\"] = amount_det\n  \n  # table[row, \"specie\"] &lt;- lfa::lfa_capitalize_first_char(table[row,\"specie\"])\n  table[row, \"area\"] &lt;- lfa::lfa_capitalize_first_char(table[row,\"area\"])\n  }\ntable$area &lt;- gsub(\"_\", \" \", table$area)\ntable$area &lt;- gsub(\"ue\", \"ü\", table$area)\ntable = table[,!names(table) %in% c(\"specie\")]\n\nknitr::kable(table, \"html\", col.names = c(\"Patch Name\",\"Location\",\"Area size (m²)\",\"Amount tree detections\" ), caption = NULL, digits = 2, escape = TRUE) |&gt;\n  kableExtra::kable_styling(\n    bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hold_position\", \"bordered\",\"responsive\"),\n    stripe_index = c(1:3,7:9),\n    full_width = FALSE\n  ) |&gt;\n  kableExtra::pack_rows(\"Beech\", 1, 3) |&gt;\n  kableExtra::pack_rows(\"Oak\", 4, 6) |&gt;\n  kableExtra::pack_rows(\"Pine\", 7, 9) |&gt;\n  kableExtra::pack_rows(\"Spruce\", 10, 12) |&gt;\n  kableExtra::column_spec(1, bold = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Summary of researched patches grouped by species, with their location, area and the amount of detected trees.\n\n\nPatch Name\nLocation\nArea size (m²)\nAmount tree detections\n\n\n\n\nBeech\n\n\nBielefeld brackwede\n(8.5244, 51.9902)\n161410.57\n1443\n\n\nBillerbeck\n(7.3273, 51.9987)\n185887.25\n1732\n\n\nWülfenrath\n(7.0769, 51.2917)\n350621.21\n2779\n\n\nOak\n\n\nHamm\n(7.8618, 51.6639)\n269397.22\n2441\n\n\nMünster\n(7.6187, 51.9174)\n164116.61\n1270\n\n\nRinkerode\n(7.6744, 51.8598)\n198811.09\n1643\n\n\nPine\n\n\nGreffen\n(8.1697, 51.9913)\n49418.81\n513\n\n\nMesum\n(7.5403, 52.2573)\n405072.85\n5031\n\n\nTelgte\n(7.7816, 52.0024)\n274132.34\n3368\n\n\nSpruce\n\n\nBrilon\n(8.5352, 51.4084)\n211478.20\n3342\n\n\nOberhundem\n(8.1861, 51.0909)\n151895.53\n2471\n\n\nOsterwald\n(8.3721, 51.2151)\n216026.43\n2806\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspecie\narea\ndensity (1/m²)\n\n\n\n\nbeech\nbielefeld_brackwede\n0.0089399\n\n\nbeech\nbillerbeck\n0.0093175\n\n\nbeech\nwuelfenrath\n0.0079259\n\n\noak\nhamm\n0.0090610\n\n\noak\nmuenster\n0.0077384\n\n\noak\nrinkerode\n0.0082641\n\n\npine\ngreffen\n0.0103807\n\n\npine\nmesum\n0.0124200\n\n\npine\ntelgte\n0.0122860\n\n\nspruce\nbrilon\n0.0158030\n\n\nspruce\noberhundem\n0.0162678\n\n\nspruce\nosterwald\n0.0129892"

It removes points outside the specified area and returns a modified LAScatalog object.\nThe specified area is identified based on the species and name attributes in the tile_location object. If a matching area is not found in areas_sf , the function stops with an error.\nThe function then transforms the spatial reference of the identified area to match that of the Lidar catalog using sf::st_transform .\nThe processing is applied to each chunk in the catalog using the identify_area function, which merges spatial information and filters out points that are not classified as inside the identified area. After processing, the function writes the modified LAS files back to the original file locations, removing points outside the specified area.\nIf an error occurs during the processing of a chunk, a warning is issued, and the function continues processing the next chunks.

The mapping function should accept a tile location object as its first argument, and additional arguments can be passed using the ellipsis ( ... ) syntax.\nThis function is useful for performing operations on multiple tile locations concurrently, such as loading Lidar data, processing areas, or other tasks that involve tile locations.\n\n\nSeealso\nThe mapping function provided should be compatible with the structure and requirements of the tile locations and the specific task being performed.\n\n\nValue\nNone\n\n\nExamples\n\n# Example usage\nlfa_map_tile_locations(tile_locations, my_mapping_function, param1 = \"value\")\n\n# Example usage\nlfa_map_tile_locations(tile_locations, my_mapping_function, param1 = \"value\")\n\n\n\nUsage\n\nlfa_map_tile_locations(tile_locations, map_function, check_flag = NULL, ...)\n\n\n\n\n5.2.18 lfa_merge_and_save\nMerge and Save Text Files in a Directory\n\nArguments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ninput_directory\nThe path to the input directory containing text files.\n\n\noutput_name\nThe name for the output file where the merged content will be saved.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nThis function takes an input directory and an output name as arguments. It merges the textual content of all files in the specified directory into a single string, with each file’s content separated by a newline character. The merged content is then saved into a file named after the output name in the same directory. After the merging is complete, all input files are deleted.\n\n\nDetails\nThis function reads the content of each text file in the specified input directory and concatenates them into a single string. Each file’s content is separated by a newline character. The merged content is then saved into a file named after the output name in the same directory. Finally, all input files are deleted from the directory.\n\n\nSeealso\nreadLines , writeLines , file.remove\n\n\nValue\nThis function does not explicitly return any value.

We needed to implement our own version of it because of various reasons:\n\nThe algorithm uses hardcoded header sizes (h1 and h2 in original) which is not feasible for our use-case of the markdown.\nWe needed to add some Quarto Markdown specifics, e.g. to make sure that the examples will not be runned.\nWe want to exclude certain tags from our implementation.\n\n\n\nDetails\nFor that reason we copied the method and made changes as needed and also added this custom documentation.\nThis function converts an Rd (R documentation) file to Markdown format (.md) and saves the converted file at the specified location. The function allows appending to an existing file or creating a new one. The resulting Markdown file includes sections for the function’s name, title, and additional content such as examples, usage, arguments, and other sections present in the Rd file.\nThe function performs the following steps:\n\nParses the Rd file using the Rd2md package.\nCreates a Markdown file with sections for the function’s name, title, and additional content.\nAppends the content to an existing file if append is set to TRUE.\nSaves the resulting Markdown file at the specified location.\n\n\n\nSeealso\nRd2md::parseRd\n\n\nValue\nThis function does not explicitly return any value. It saves the converted Markdown file at the specified location as described in the details section.\n\n\nExamples\n\n# Convert Rd file to Markdown and save it\nlfa_rd_to_md(\"path/to/your/file.Rd\", \"path/to/your/output/file.md\")\n\n# Convert Rd file to Markdown and append to an existing file\nlfa_rd_to_md(\"path/to/your/file.Rd\", \"path/to/existing/output/file.md\", append = TRUE)\n\n\n\nUsage\n\nlfa_rd_to_qmd(rdfile, outfile, append = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n5.2.20 lfa_rd_to_results\nConvert Rd Files to Markdown and Merge Results\n\nDescription\nThis function converts all Rd (R documentation) files in the “man” directory to Markdown format (.qmd) and saves the converted files in the “results/appendix/package-docs” directory. It then merges the converted Markdown files into a single string and saves the merged content into a file named “docs.qmd” in the “results/appendix/package-docs” directory.\n\n\nDetails\nThe function performs the following steps:\n\nRemoves any existing “docs.qmd” file in the “results/appendix/package-docs” directory.\nFinds all Rd files in the “man” directory.\nConverts each Rd file to Markdown format (.qmd) using the lfa_rd_to_qmd function.\nSaves the converted Markdown files in the “results/appendix/package-docs” directory.\nMerges the content of all converted Markdown files into a single string.\nSaves the merged content into a file named “docs.qmd” in the “results/appendix/package-docs” directory.\n\n\n\nSeealso\nlfa_rd_to_qmd , lfa_merge_and_save\n\n\nValue\nThis function does not explicitly return any value. It performs the conversion, merging, and saving operations as described in the details section.\n\n\nExamples\n\n# Convert Rd files to Markdown and merge the results\nlfa_rd_to_results()\n\n\n\nUsage\n\nlfa_rd_to_results()\n\n\n\n\n5.2.21 lfa_segmentation\nSegment the elements of an point cloud by trees\n\nArguments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nctg\nAn LASCatalog object. If not null, it will perform the actions on this object, if NULL inferring the catalog from the tile_location\n\n\ntile_location\nA tile_location type object holding the information about the location of the catalog. This is used to save the catalog after processing too.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\nJakob Danel\n\n\nDescription\nThis function will try to to divide the hole point cloud into unique trees. Therefore it is assigning for each chunk of the catalog a treeID for each point. Therefore the algorithm uses the li2012 implementation with the following parameters: li2012(dt1 = 2, dt2 = 3, R = 2, Zu = 10, hmin = 5, speed_up = 12) NOTE : The operation is in place and can not be reverted, the old values of the point cloud will be deleted!\n\n\nValue\nA catalog where each chunk has additional treeID values indicating the belonging tree.\n\n\nUsage\n\nlfa_segmentation(ctg, tile_location)\n\n\n\n\n5.2.22 lfa_set_flag\nSet a flag to indicate the completion of a specific process.\n\nArguments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nflag_name\nA character string specifying the name of the flag file. It should be a descriptive and unique identifier for the process being flagged.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nThis function creates a hidden flag file at a specified location within the working directory to indicate that a particular processing step has been completed. If the flag file already exists, a warning is issued.\n\n\nValue\nThis function does not have a formal return value.\n\n\nExamples\n\n# Set the flag for a process named \"data_processing\"\nlfa_set_flag(\"data_processing\")\n\n\n\nUsage\n\nlfa_set_flag(flag_name)"

    "text": "In this research study, the management and processing of a large dataset are crucial considerations. The dataset’s substantial size necessitates careful maintenance to ensure efficient handling. Furthermore, the data should be easily processable and editable to facilitate necessary corrections and precalculations within the context of our research objectives. To achieve our goals, we have implemented a framework that automatically derives data based on a shapefile, delineating areas of interest. The processed data and results of precalculations are stored in a straightforward manner to enhance accessibility. Additionally, we have designed functions that establish a user-friendly interface, enabling the execution of algorithms on subsets of the data, such as distinct species. These interfaces are not only directly callable by users but can also be integrated into other functions to automate processes. The overarching aim is to streamline the entire preprocessing workflow using a single script, leveraging only the shapefile as a basis. This subsection details the accomplishments of our R-package in realizing these goals, outlining the preprocessing steps undertaken and justifying their necessity in the context of our research.\nThe data are stored in a data subdirectory of the root directory in the format species/location-name/tile-name. To automate the matching of areas of interest with the catalog from the Land NRW1, we utilize the intersecting tool developed by Heisig2. This tool, allows for the automatic retrieval and placement of data downloaded from the Land NRW catalog. To enhance data accessibility, we have devised an object that incorporates species, location name, and tile name (the NRW internal identifier) for each area This object facilitates the specification of the area to be processed. Additionally, we have defined an initialization function that downloads all tiles, returning a list of tile location objects for subsequent processing. A pivotal component of the package’s preprocessing functionality is the map function, which iterates over a list of tile locations (effectively the entire dataset) and accepts a processing function as an argument. The subsequent paragraph outlines the specific preprocessing steps employed, all of which are implemented within the mapping function.\nTo facilitate memory-handling capabilities, each of the tiles, where one area can span multiple tiles, has been split into manageable chunks. We employed a 50x50m size for each tile, resulting in the division of original 1km x 1km files into 400 tiles. These tiles are stored in our directory structure, with each tile housed in a directory named after its tile name and assigned an id as the filename. Implementation-wise, the lidr::catalog_retile function was instrumental in achieving this segmentation. The resulting smaller chunks allow for efficient iteration during subsequent preprocessing steps.\nThe next phase involves reducing our data to the actual size by intersecting the tiles with the defined area of interest. Using the lidR::merge_spatial function, we intersect the area derived from the shapefile, removing all point cloud items outside this region. Due to our tile-wise approach, empty tiles may arise, and in such cases, those tiles are simply deleted.\nFollowing the size reduction to our dataset, the next step involves correcting the z values. The z values in the data are originally relative to the ellipsoid used for referencing, but we require them to be relative to the ground. To achieve this, we utilize the lidR::tin function, which extrapolates a convex hull between all ground points (classified by the data provider) and calculates the z value based on this structure.\nSubsequently, we aim to perform segmentation for each distinct tree, marking each item of the point cloud with a tree ID. We employ the algorithm described by @li2012, using parameters li2012(dt1 = 2, dt2 = 3, R = 2, Zu = 10, hmin = 5, speed_up = 12). The meanings of these parameters are elucidated in Li et al.’s work [@li2012].\nFinally, the last preprocessing step involves individual tree detection, seeking a single POINT object for each tree. The lidR::lmf function, an implementation of the tree data using a local maximum approach, is utilized for this purpose [@popescu2004]. The results are stored in GeoPackage files within our data structure.\nSee ?@sec-appendix-preprocessing for the implementation of the preprocessing."
