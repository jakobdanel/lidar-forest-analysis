## Contributions

Most of the work was done in pair programming. In the following sections we highlight, our key contributions to the project.

### Frederick

My contributions to the project encompassed several areas: data acquisition, preprocessing, visualization, random forest implementation, and canopy height modeling.

In data acquisition, I sourced relevant datasets, particularly focusing on obtaining patches where one tree species exhibited dominance, navigating through existing datasets such as the *Waldmonitor* dataset and utilizing maps indicating dominant tree species in Nordrhein-Westfalia (NRW). Ensuring the validity of the selected patches, considering factors such as patch size and species diversity was a challenge I faced, teaching me the importance of meticulous data selection and validation.

Preprocessing involved essential steps such as tiling and height normalization to standardize the data and facilitate further analysis, with the challenge lying in optimizing these steps to retain relevant information while minimizing noise and artifacts, deepening my understanding of data standardization's impact on downstream analyses.

Visualizing the data through density plots and boxplots was instrumental in gaining insights into the distribution and characteristics of the variables under study, with the challenge being to balance clarity and complexity, enhancing my visualization skills and effective communication of key findings.

Implementing the Random Forest algorithm for species classification involved model training, validation, and performance evaluation, with generating scores and confusion matrices allowing us to assess the model's accuracy and identify areas for improvement, deepening my understanding of machine learning techniques.

Developing a canopy height model provided valuable insights into remote sensing techniques and their applicability in forestry research.

Overall, my contributions to the project have enriched my skills and knowledge in research methods and data analysis techniques, contributing to the project's success while broadening my expertise in the field of forestry and environmental science.

### Jakob

In the broader context of a comprehensive lidar data analysis project, my contributions were instrumental in advancing key components. The preprocessing phase saw enhancements in Intersection, Detection, and Segmentation processes. I played a pivotal role in refining Intersection by overlaying lidar data onto shapefiles, ensuring a coherent file structure. Additionally, my efforts in Detection focused on optimizing tree identification within the intersected data. I developed the tree Segmentation too.

In terms of visualization, my contributions elevated the understanding of lidar data. The presentation of the confusion matrix as a colored table provided a comprehensive view of classification performance. Through the implementation of bar plots for patch-level data, I contributed to insights into the distribution of features. Precision and recall metrics were effectively communicated via bar plots, offering a nuanced evaluation of the model's performance. The integration of Canopy Height Plots further enriched the visual representation of canopy structures.

Within the tree-level distribution analysis, my role extended to Data Preparation and the application of KLD and JSD. I ensured that the dataset was well-structured and prepared for analysis. Moreover, my involvement in researching methods, implementing calculations, and dynamically building result tables for KLD and JSD significantly contributed to the depth of the analysis.

In the development of an interface for Lidar data, I played a crucial role in designing a structured file system for efficient data storage. The implementation of various functions, including `lfa::map_tile_locations`, `lfa::visit_all_areas`, and `lfa::combine_sf_object`, showcased my commitment to enhancing data iteration and combination processes.

Throughout the project, my contributions led to valuable learnings for the team. I actively addressed challenges associated with handling big data in R and underscored the importance of structured data storage. The development of an R-package was a testament to my commitment to enhancing functionality and promoting reusability. Additionally, my insights deepened the team's understanding of package workflows in R.

Despite encountering challenges with lidR mapping functions, my proactive approach to debugging, including the development of a custom mapping solution, showcased my resilience and commitment to overcoming obstacles. In summary, my contributions significantly shaped the success and advancement of the broader lidar data analysis project.
