# Methods

We first describe the processes of data acquisition and data preprocessing. Then we will propose how we analyse the distributions and how we utilize random forest predictions for species distinguishing.

# Results

First we present the researched areas, after that we look into distribution characterics. Lastly we present a set of generated random forest models and their accuracy.
