# Introduction

Forests, referred as the "world's air-conditioning system" or the "lungs of the planet," play a critical role in maintaining the global environment, as noted by King Charles III. Delving into forests and their diverse tree species is essential for our comprehension of both local ecosystems and the broader globe. The combination of tree species significantly contributes to the functionality and biodiversity of a forest, as emphasized by Mori et al. in their work on forest tree biodiversity [@mori2017]. Different tree species face distinct threats, posing challenges to both the environment and human populations. For instance, the Oak processionary moth, highlighted by Sobczyk et al  [@sobczyk2014eichenprozessionsspinner]. in their study on the impact of the oak processionary moth, and the bark beetle, discussed in the work of Müller et al. on bark beetle infestations [@muller2019kaferkampfe], exemplify the varying risks associated with specific tree types.Forests play a pivotal role in climate regulation by absorbing carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) and providing habitats for a multitude of animal and plant species. Approximately 80% of all terrestrial species find their home in forests, housing more than four-fifths of all known animal and plant species outside the oceans [@Naturefund]. Recognizing the importance of gaining a comprehensive understanding of forests is imperative, particularly in unraveling the (spatial) distribution patterns of different tree species. Such insights are crucial for informed conservation efforts, sustainable management, and addressing the diverse ecological challenges that forests face.

Often, forest monitoring relies on Sentinel data, offering valuable insights through various applications such as time series analysis of the deforestation process [@cremer2020potential], forest classification [@dostalova2021european], and detection of forest succession [@szostak2018using]. However, employing Sentinel data is not without challenges. Dependency on cloud coverage and limited resolution, such as the 5x5m resolution on Sentinel-1 [@copernicusSentinel1Missions], can hinder the accurate identification of individual trees.To overcome these limitations, LiDAR data emerges as a promising alternative. LiDAR provides higher resolutions and utilizes the intensity of the returned signal as an indicator of the forest structure [@dlrRaumfahrtagenturLidar]. The aim is to investigate whether LiDAR is an appropriate tool for distinguishing between tree species, with a focus on oak, beech, pine, and spruce – the most common species in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW). This choice ensures comparable environmental conditions, including climate and altitude.

The methodology involves employing different statistical tools to analyze the distribution of LiDAR returns. Specifically, the study utilizes the random forest algorithm to predict the species of detected trees based on LiDAR data. This approach aims to enhance the precision and capabilities of forest monitoring, especially in regions like NRW, by leveraging LiDAR technology for species-specific insights. Our motivation and methodical approach leading to the following research question:

**Can LiDAR technology be effectively employed to distinguish between tree species in monocultural forests in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), and how do the distinctive characteristics of individual tree species contribute to the accuracy of LiDAR-based classification?**

We formulate the following hypothesis:

1. LiDAR data can effectively differentiate between tree species in monocultural forests in NRW, and there are statistically significant differences in the LiDAR-derived metrics among the various tree species.
2. Random Forest classification can be used to predict the tree species of trees in monoculteral forests.
3. Random Forest classification performance varies significantly depending on the set of LiDAR parameters used, indicating that certain combinations of parameters contribute more effectively to accurate tree species classification.
