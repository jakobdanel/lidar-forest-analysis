## Further Work

Our work has laid the foundation for further exploration and refinement in the field of tree species prediction and analysis. As we reflect on our findings, several avenues for future research and optimization strategies emerge.

One promising direction involves delving into the predictability of other tree species. While our study focused on Beech, Oak, Pine, and Spruce, primarily due to their regional relevance, investigating the performance of our methods on a broader spectrum of species could provide valuable insights into the generalizability of our models.

Expanding the geographical scope of our approach is another intriguing prospect. Our study was confined to a localized area in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW). Testing the project's performance in diverse regions with similar species could unravel variations influenced by different environmental conditions. Additionally, exploring potential spatial trends in derived parameters and model performance could enhance our understanding of broader patterns.

If tree-level datasets are available, future research could test the derived parameters without the assumption that all trees within a patch share the same species. This would offer a more nuanced representation of individual tree characteristics and potentially enhance the accuracy of the random forest models.

Quantitative parameter selection methods present an opportunity for optimization. Moving beyond a trial-and-error approach, incorporating metrics like Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) and Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) into the selection process could provide a systematic and data-driven way to identify relevant parameters. Advanced techniques, such as reinforced learning methods, may also hold promise in this context.

Dataset quality optimization, particularly the removal of outliers, is another avenue for exploration. Many character distributions in our dataset exhibited outliers, and assessing the impact of outlier removal on random forest accuracy could be a valuable optimization strategy.

Finally, exploring additional tree statistics beyond those considered in our current study could enrich our understanding. This might involve investigating intensity distribution, the number of returns distribution on the z-axis per tree, and more sophisticated spatial point pattern analyses [@pebesma2023spatial]. Techniques like Ripleyâ€™s reduced second moment function [@ripley1977modelling] could offer deeper insights into spatial patterns.

Incorporating these avenues into future research endeavors has the potential to advance the field, refining methodologies and expanding the applicability of tree species prediction and analysis. Our work, while a significant step forward, lays the groundwork for a more comprehensive exploration of the intricacies within this domain.
