## Findings

Now, we will delve into the findings derived from the previously presented results, discussing them in the context of the hypotheses outlined in the Introduction. As we move forward, the discussion will delve into the alignment of our findings with the initial hypotheses, shedding light on the effectiveness of the employed methodology and the insights gained from the analysis.

**LiDAR data can effectively differentiate between tree species in monocultural forests in NRW, and there are statistically significant differences in the LiDAR-derived metrics among the various tree species.**

The statement provided offers a nuanced perspective on the effectiveness of tree species differentiation based on the analysis conducted. It is acknowledged that the effectiveness of differentiation is intricately tied to the chosen criteria and the specific species under consideration. Notably, certain patch-level statistics, such as tree density, emerge as robust indicators for distinguishing between tree species. However, when scrutinizing the distribution of characteristics at the individual tree level, the variance between the distributions of patches from the same species is often not significantly smaller than the variance between distributions of different species. This observation suggests that relying solely on characteristics at the tree level might not yield distinct species differentiation. An interesting finding is the effectiveness of distinguishing between conifers and deciduous trees, with notable differences, particularly concerning Spruce trees. The identified dissimilarities, especially when comparing Spruce trees to other species, underscore the potential for effective differentiation in certain instances. The conclusion drawn emphasizes the importance of generating a comprehensive set of statistics for a defined area of interest and comparing the results to sample patches. This approach provides a robust indicator of the species distribution within the specified area. Importantly, the recommendation is against solely relying on one selected parameter, given the relatively high variance observed within the same species. Instead, a multifaceted analysis involving various parameters proves more effective in characterizing and distinguishing tree species in a given region.

**Random Forest classification can be used to predict the tree species of trees in monoculteral forests.**

The presented statement accurately captures the key findings and insights derived from the analysis of the tree models. It is affirmed that all tree models can be partially utilized to distinguish between tree species. However, not all models demonstrated consistently good results across all classes, with oak scoring moderately to low on the tree models. The observation that utilizing patch-level information for training the model enhances performance aligns with the understanding that aggregating information at a higher level of abstraction can provide more robust insights. Furthermore, the notable success in distinguishing between conifers and deciduous trees, especially with the last model, highlights the efficacy of the approach, showcasing high accuracy in this particular differentiation. The conclusion drawn, emphasizing the effectiveness of looking into all tree parameters for distinguishing between inspected tree species using the random forest method, underscores the comprehensive nature of the analysis. It suggests that a holistic consideration of multiple parameters enhances the model's ability to accurately classify and distinguish between different tree species.

**Random Forest classification performance varies significantly depending on the set of LiDAR parameters used, indicating that certain combinations of parameters contribute more effectively to accurate tree species classification.**

The provided statement accurately characterizes the findings regarding the quality of results obtained from the three models and highlights important nuances in the analysis. Indeed, the quality of results exhibits high variance across all three models, considering overall statistics such as accuracy and Kohen's Kappa, as well as class-specific measures like precision and recall. The mention of presenting only some highlights of the researched parameter combinations emphasizes that the models' performance is influenced by a multitude of factors. The observation that incorporating segmentation parameters into the last model leads to a decrease in performance underscores the sensitivity of the model to specific parameter combinations. The statement further notes the high dependency of model performance on the utilized tree characteristics, with significant variations across different classes. For instance, the predictability of beech is highlighted, showcasing that certain parameters, such as tree heights and distance to neighbors, play a more crucial role in accurate predictions compared to others. The insight that another machine learning approach that can recognize the importance of specific parameters for the prediction of a certain class might be beneficial suggests avenues for further exploration and model refinement. Additionally, the variation in the power of differentiation between conifers and deciduous trees among the three models, with the last model outperforming others, reinforces the significance of the approach that incorporates patch-level information. This observation hints at the importance of considering a holistic view of the forest rather than relying solely on individual tree characteristics for certain tasks. In conclusion, the statement provides a comprehensive overview of the complexities and considerations involved in interpreting and optimizing the machine learning models for tree species prediction based on the dataset and analysis conducted.
