## Limitations

Our approach, while yielding valuable insights, is not without its set of assumptions and limitations, each deserving careful consideration to grasp the nuances of our findings.

Firstly, the assumption that all trees within the chosen areas of interest share the same species is integral to our methodology. While this assumption facilitates the development of predictive models, we acknowledge that 100% monocultural forests are rare in reality. Our validation process, primarily relying on Sentinel images, raises potential concerns regarding the inadvertent selection of mixed forests. Such a scenario could significantly impact the distribution of tree characteristics and introduce inaccuracies in the ground truth used for training the random forest algorithm.
 The temporal aspect of LiDAR data collection is a crucial factor that can significantly impact various LiDAR characteristics. LiDAR data may be captured at different seasons of the year, and these seasonal variations can introduce substantial differences in the derived information. For instance, the number of returns and intensities in LiDAR data can be highly influenced by the season during which the data is collected. Seasonal changes in vegetation, such as leaf growth or shedding, can impact the LiDAR returns. Another key assumption revolves around the representation of naturally grown forests in our areas of interest. Given the absence of true natural forests in Germany and North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) due to forestry practices, our study areas may consist of newly planted or managed forests with differing characteristics. While this could potentially influence our analysis, we consider the impact relatively minor given the prevalent managed nature of forests in the region.

We assumed the independence of each forest in our study from its spatial environment. However, forests are inherently influenced by various factors such as neighborhood type, altitude, climate, and the presence of fauna. Despite our efforts to draw samples from diverse locations in NRW, these environmental variations persist, introducing a layer of complexity to our analysis.
 The relatively small sample size, with only three areas of interest per species, is another limitation. Increasing the sample size would undoubtedly enhance the robustness of our analysis and mitigate potential drawbacks associated with the limited number of samples. The correctness of our detection process, reliant on the accuracy of the LiDAR point cloud, is a crucial aspect. While the algorithm employed is established and widely used, the precision of our results hinges on the accuracy of the LiDAR detection process. Lastly, we acknowledge technical limitations, notably the tile-based segmentation approach used for processing efficiency. The choice of $50\times50$m tiles, while suitable for practical hardware constraints, introduces potential challenges near tile borders. Trees located at these borders may be counted as two separate trees during the segmentation process, impacting our results.

In conclusion, understanding these assumptions and limitations is paramount for a nuanced interpretation of our results. Each aspect informs the intricacies of our methodology and underscores potential areas for refinement in future studies.
