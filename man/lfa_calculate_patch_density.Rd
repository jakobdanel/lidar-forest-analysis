\title{Calculate patch density for specified areas based on detection data}
\usage{
lfa_calculate_patch_density(
  areas_location = "research_areas.shp",
  detections = lfa::lfa_get_detections()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{areas_location}{The file path to a shapefile containing spatial polygons
representing the areas for which patch density needs to be calculated.
Default is "research_areas.shp".}

\item{detections}{A data frame containing detection information, where each row represents
a detection and includes the 'area' column specifying the corresponding area.
Default is obtained using lfa_get_detections().}
}
\value{
A data frame with patch density information for each specified area.
Columns include 'name' (area name), 'geometry' (polygon geometry), 'area_size' (patch area size),
'detections' (number of detections in the patch), and 'density' (computed patch density).
}
\description{
This function calculates patch density for specified areas using detection data.
It reads the spatial polygons from a shapefile, computes the area size for each patch,
counts the number of detections in each patch, and calculates the patch density.
}
\examples{
# Assuming you have a shapefile 'your_research_areas.shp' and detection data
# from lfa_get_detections()
density_data <- lfa_calculate_patch_density(areas_location = "your_research_areas.shp")
print(density_data)
