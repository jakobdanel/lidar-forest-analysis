\title{Create neighbor mean curves for specified areas}
\usage{
lfa_create_neighbor_mean_curves(neighbors, use_avg = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{neighbors}{A data frame containing information about neighbors, where each column represents
a specific neighbor, and each row corresponds to an area.}

\item{use_avg}{Logical. If TRUE, the function computes average curves across all neighbors.
If FALSE, it computes curves for individual neighbors.}
}
\value{
A data frame with mean curves for each specified area.
Columns represent areas, and rows represent index values.
}
\description{
This function generates mean curves for a specified set of areas based on neighbor data.
The user can choose to compute mean curves for individual neighbors or averages across neighbors.
}
\examples{
# Assuming you have a data frame 'your_neighbors_data' with neighbor information
mean_curves <- lfa_create_neighbor_mean_curves(your_neighbors_data, use_avg = TRUE)
print(mean_curves)

}
